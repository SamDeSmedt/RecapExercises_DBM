select * from booking where dateto is NULL;
select avg(price) from room;
select sum(price) from room where type="double";
select count(distinct(guestno)) from booking where (datefrom <= 2022-08-01 and dateto >= 2022-08-01) or (datefrom >= 2022-08-01 and datefrom <= 2022-08-31);
select price, type from room join hotel on room.hotelno=hotel.hotelno where hotelname= "The Tower Hotel";
select guest from booking join hotel on booking.hotelno=hotel.hotelno join guest on booking.guestno=guest.guestno where hotelname="The Tower Hotel" and date(now()) between datefrom and dateto;
select * from booking join guest on booking.guestno=guest.guestno join hotel on booking.hotelno=hotel.hotelno join room on booking.roomno=room.roomno and booking.hotelno=room.hotelno where hotelname="The Tower Hotel" and date(now()) between datefrom and dateto;
select sum(price) from booking join hotel on booking.hotelno=hotel.hotelno join room on booking.hotelno=room.hotelno and booking.roomno=room.roomno where hotelname="The Tower Hotel" and date(now()) between datefrom and dateto;

select * from room join hotel on hotel.hotelno=room.hotelno where roomno not in (select room.roomno from booking join hotel on booking.hotelno=hotel.hotelno join room on booking.hotelno=room.hotelno and booking.roomno=room.roomno where hotelname ="The Tower Hotel" and date(now()) between datefrom and dateto) and hotelname="The Tower Hotel";

Explanation:
1) create a query to make a selection of the rooms that are occupied

select room.roomno from booking join hotel on booking.hotelno=hotel.hotelno join room on booking.hotelno=room.hotelno and booking.roomno=room.roomno where hotelname ="The Tower Hotel" and date(now()) between datefrom and dateto

2) create a new query that excludes the outcome of the firtst query

select * from hotel join room on hotel.hotelno=room.hotelno where room.roomno not in (select room.roomno from booking join hotel on booking.hotelno=hotel.hotelno join room on booking.hotelno=room.hotelno and booking.roomno=room.roomno where hotelname="The Tower Hotel" and date(now()) between datefrom and dateto) and hotelname="The Tower Hotel";

3) Still use all tables that are necessary to complete the question

select sum(price) from hotel join room on hotel.hotelno=room.hotelno where room.roomno not in (select room.roomno from booking join hotel on booking.hotelno=hotel.hotelno join room on booking.hotelno=room.hotelno and booking.roomno=room.roomno where hotelname="The Tower Hotel" and date(now()) between datefrom and dateto) and hotelname="The Tower Hotel";
select hotelname, count(*) from hotel join room on hotel.hotelno=room.hotelno where city="London" group by hotelname;
select * from (select hotelname,type,count(type) from hotel join room on hotel.hotelno=room.hotelno join booking on booking.roomno=room.roomno and hotel.hotelno=booking.hotelno where hotel.city ="London" group by hotelname, type order by count(type) desc) as sel1 group by sel1.hotelname;
update room set price=price*1.05;
